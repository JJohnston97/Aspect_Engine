Requirements\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Native Client S\+DK (\href{https://developer.chrome.com/native-client}{\tt https\+://developer.\+chrome.\+com/native-\/client}), (tested with Pepper version 33 or higher).
\end{DoxyItemize}

The S\+DL backend for Chrome\textquotesingle{}s Native Client has been tested only with the P\+Na\+Cl toolchain, which generates binaries designed to run on A\+RM and x86\+\_\+32/64 platforms. This does not mean it won\textquotesingle{}t work with the other toolchains! 

 \section*{Building S\+DL for Na\+Cl }

Set up the right environment variables (see naclbuild.\+sh), then configure S\+DL with\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}configure --host=pnacl --prefix some/install/destination
\end{DoxyVerb}


Then \char`\"{}make\char`\"{}.

As an example of how to create a deployable app a Makefile project is provided in test/nacl/\+Makefile, which includes some monkey patching of the common.\+mk file provided by Na\+Cl, without which linking properly to S\+DL won\textquotesingle{}t work (the search path can\textquotesingle{}t be modified externally, so the linker won\textquotesingle{}t find S\+DL\textquotesingle{}s binaries unless you dump them into the S\+DK path, which is inconvenient). Also provided in test/nacl is the required support file, such as index.\+html, manifest.\+json, etc. S\+DL apps for Na\+Cl run on a worker thread using the ppapi\+\_\+simple infrastructure. This allows for blocking calls on all the relevant systems (Open\+GL ES, filesystem), hiding the asynchronous nature of the browser behind the scenes...which is not the same as making it disappear!



 \section*{Running tests }

Due to the nature of Na\+Cl programs, building and running S\+DL tests is not as straightforward as one would hope. The script naclbuild.\+sh in build-\/scripts automates the process and should serve as a guide for users of S\+DL trying to build their own applications.

Basic usage\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}./naclbuild.sh path/to/pepper/toolchain (i.e. ~/naclsdk/pepper_35)
\end{DoxyVerb}


This will build testgles2.\+c by default.

If you want to build a different test, for example testrendercopyex.\+c\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}SOURCES=~/sdl/SDL/test/testrendercopyex.c ./naclbuild.sh ~/naclsdk/pepper_35
\end{DoxyVerb}


Once the build finishes, you have to serve the contents with a web server (the script will give you instructions on how to do that with Python). 

 \section*{R\+Wops and nacl\+\_\+io }

\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_s_d_l___r_wops}{S\+D\+L\+\_\+\+R\+Wops}} work transparently with nacl\+\_\+io. Two functions control the mount points\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}int mount(const char* source, const char* target, 
                  const char* filesystemtype, 
                  unsigned long mountflags, const void *data);
int umount(const char *target);

For convenience, SDL will by default mount an httpfs tree at / before calling 
\end{DoxyVerb}
 the app\textquotesingle{}s main function. Such setting can be overridden by calling\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}umount("/");
\end{DoxyVerb}


And then mounting a different filesystem at /

It\textquotesingle{}s important to consider that the asynchronous nature of file operations on a browser is hidden from the application, effectively providing the developer with a set of blocking file operations just like you get in a regular desktop environment, which eases the job of porting to Native Client, but also introduces a set of challenges of its own, in particular when big file sizes and slow connections are involved.

For more information on how nacl\+\_\+io and mount points work, see\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}https://developer.chrome.com/native-client/devguide/coding/nacl_io
https://src.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src/native_client_sdk/src/libraries/nacl_io/nacl_io.h
\end{DoxyVerb}


To be able to save into the directory \char`\"{}/save/\char`\"{} (like backup of game) \+: \begin{DoxyVerb}mount("", "/save", "html5fs", 0, "type=PERSISTENT");
\end{DoxyVerb}


And add to manifest.\+json \+: \begin{DoxyVerb}"permissions": [
    "unlimitedStorage"
]
\end{DoxyVerb}
