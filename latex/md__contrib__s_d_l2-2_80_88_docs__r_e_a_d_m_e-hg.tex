The latest development version of S\+DL is available via Mercurial. Mercurial allows you to get up-\/to-\/the-\/minute fixes and enhancements; as a developer works on a source tree, you can use \char`\"{}hg\char`\"{} to mirror that source tree instead of waiting for an official release. Please look at the Mercurial website ( \href{https://www.mercurial-scm.org/}{\tt https\+://www.\+mercurial-\/scm.\+org/} ) for more information on using hg, where you can also download software for Mac OS X, Windows, and Unix systems. \begin{DoxyVerb}hg clone http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL
\end{DoxyVerb}


If you are building S\+DL via configure, you will need to run autogen.\+sh before running configure.

There is a web interface to the subversion repository at\+: \href{http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/}{\tt http\+://hg.\+libsdl.\+org/\+S\+D\+L/}

There is an R\+SS feed available at that U\+RL, for those that want to track commits in real time.
