\item A pandora specific video driver was written to allow S\+DL 2.\+0 with Open\+GL ES support to work on the pandora under the framebuffer. This driver do not have input support for now, so if you use it you will have to add your own control code. The video driver name is \char`\"{}pandora\char`\"{} so if you have problem running it from the framebuffer, try to set the following variable before starting your application \+: \char`\"{}export S\+D\+L\+\_\+\+V\+I\+D\+E\+O\+D\+R\+I\+V\+E\+R=pandora\char`\"{}
\item Open\+GL ES support was added to the x11 driver, so it\textquotesingle{}s working like the normal x11 driver one with Open\+G\+LX support, with S\+DL input event\textquotesingle{}s etc..
